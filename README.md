This repository hosts an RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline designed to investigate the transcriptomic effects of TDP-43 protein depletion in HeLa cells, utilizing dataset GSE136366. The study analyzes sequencing data from three TDP-43 Knockout and three Rescue (Wild-Type) biological replicates. Prior to the statistical analysis, the raw reads underwent rigorous upstream processing in a Linux environment, which included quality control via FastQC, adapter removal and quality trimming using Trimmomatic, and alignment to the Homo sapiens genome (GRCh38.95) using the STAR aligner. Gene abundance was subsequently quantified using htseq-count. The downstream analysis, implemented in the provided R script, leverages the DESeq2 package to normalize count matrices and identify differentially expressed genes. To ensure robust results, the workflow includes a pre-filtering step to remove low-expression genes (row sums < 100) and applies strict statistical thresholds, requiring an Adjusted p-value (padj) of less than 0.01 and a Log2 Fold Change greater than 0.58. The pipeline generates quality control visualizations, including PCA plots that demonstrate a clear separation between experimental conditions (capturing 59% variance on PC1), and exports the significant biomarkers to a CSV file.
